# TabEmbed

This is TabEmbed, a minimalist, opinionated component to lay-out your contents within a tabbed interface.
It gives you a small, adaptive HTML/CSS base on which you can apply your design decisions.
The objective is to keep the component independent of its context and content but also to undo or overide as less as possible.
Naturally, it is handled by JavaScript (with a handy API) which takes all the advantages of CSS. JavaScript is only for sugar!
